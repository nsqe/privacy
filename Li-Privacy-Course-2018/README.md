# The Changing Right to Privacy
#### Tiffany Li, August 2018

My friend Tiffany Li is teaching a course on privacy at Yale (because she is super badass and brilliant). She shared her syllabus and kindly gave me permission to reproduce it here. 

## Course Description

As the world becomes increasingly digitized, privacy has become an issue of vital importance for lawyers, judges, scholars, and policymakers. Recent privacy controversies include the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, reports of government surveillance using (possibly faulty) facial recognition technologies, and DNA testing companies selling consumer genetic data to the pharmaceutical industry.

This reading group will pursue advanced study of the changing right to privacy, exploring high-level privacy theories and cutting-edge, topical problems in privacy law. Materials and discussions will incorporate a diverse, interdisciplinary array of privacy perspectives and approaches, with a focus on how conceptions of privacy and identity have changed over time. The goal of this reading group is to encourage students to develop their own nuanced perspectives on privacy law and to provide an opportunity to engage in dialogue on the most pressing privacy issues of today and the future.
